                I am a software developer currently living in Seattle. My first foray into programming
                was in the fall of 2012 when I entered college at the University of Washington and enrolled
                in an intro to Java class. At first, as I'm sure is true for many who are new to coding, I
                felt a bit lost navigating this new academic and theoretical territory of computer science,
                but, as time went on, the lightbulbs continued to go off as I grew more and more comfortable
                with programming and began to see the consistent and predictable patterns of logic built in
                to the craft. I took the next level Java class - introduction to data structures and then
                took the intro to web development class where I got my first taste of HTML, CSS, Javascript,
                and the like.

                However, the idea of sitting at a computer programming all day (which is itself a bit of a 
                mischaracterization and oversimplification of what coding is) didn't excite me enough to
                continue pursuing that particular academic route.

                Post college I worked for a few years as the warehouse manager of a wholesale merchandising
                company, but I increasingly found my mind wandering more and more towards ideas that could
                only be brought to life as software and so I began an independent study of Python for a time,
                as it was a language that I knew had robust community support and, compared to Java, it was
                far less verbose and read more clearly to me as English.
            </p>

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;
                Eventually, I resigned my position as warehouse manager with my company and ultimately decided
                I wanted to expand my programming knowledge base in a regimented and structured way and so I
                enrolled in a web development bootcamp offered by the University of Washington.
            </p>

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;
                In doing so, I intended to learn more about the modern web development framework - and certainly
                I did - but I also discovered (or perhaps rediscovered) a passion for programming that I
                had not anticipated and I realized (much to my delight) just how inaccurate my prior notion of
                life as a developer was.

                It is equal parts logical and artistic, systemic and creative. It encourages thoughtfulness and
                precision. For me it is rewarding in practice and it is rewarding conceptually
            </p>

            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;
                Perhaps best of all though, it is a tool universal enough to be applied towards creating solutions
                that address the things I care most about in life - everything from sustainable energy technologies
                to automtaing away the mundane stresses of life.
